# Bloodpoint Farming Macros!
Macros to help with the repetitive/tedious aspects of farming bloodpoints in Dead by Daylight!

> [!CAUTION]
> These macros are focused on reducing repetitive stress injures while farming--not competitive advantage. However, they are still at odds with the BHVR Terms of Use. Use them at your own risk.

## How to Use
1. Install [AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
2. Download the latest macros at https://BloodpointFarming.github.io/Bloodpoint-Farming-Macros/Bloodpoint-Farming-Macros.zip
3. Extract *everything* in the zip file.
4. Open the .ahk files you want to run. (e.g. just double click them)
5. To turn off the macro, open your system tray > right click the macro > Exit

### FPS Switch (sleep)

## Automatic Updates
Scripts automatically check for updates and ask to update when new fixes and macros are added.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Updating will overwrite the whole directory, including any macro changes or new files you've added.
> If you'd prefer to manage updates manually, `git clone https://github.com/BloodpointFarming/Bloodpoint-Farming-Macros.git` instead. Scripts will not auto-update if they're run from in a git repo.
